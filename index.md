  - Distributed training: experimented with distributing training load to multi-workers and experimented with strategies such as collective     communication leading to 50% performance boost.
  - Image segmentation: automated masking cars from backgrounds in studio shots with modified CNN architecture reduced 90% of loss on    overall images collections.
  - Improved accuracy of Spanish to English machine translation by improving encoder decoder model with attention.

- Tap Beat: music game on Android build with cpp
  - Reduced gaming visual adaptation with simplistic interface interaction with OpenGL surface.
  - Utilized Google Oboe to manage audio files, created audio stream to send data into audio speaker.
  - Created Mixer to allow playing multiple sounds simultaneously, used LockFreeQueue to manage events threads.
